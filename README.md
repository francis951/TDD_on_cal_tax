If you want a bit more practice at test first, write a tax calculator that calculates tax using the following brackets
 
If earnings < 12000 per year, pay no tax
then with earnings between 12,000 and 36,000 pay 20% tax
then with earnings greater than 36000 per year, pay 40% tax

Use a test first approach.  Commit at least after every passing test.

Enjoy!
